### About the PACTA Climate Test 2022

Switzerland and its financial market are committed to transitioning to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 to achieve its obligations under the Paris Agreement of limiting global warming to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.  The PACTA Climate Test 2022 provides comparable information on the progress of the Swiss financial market and across the individual participating financial institutions to meet the climate goals. `r investor_name` was invited to the test by the FOEN ([link](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/climate/info-specialists/climate-and-financial-markets.html)) and SIF ([link](https://www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/finanzmarktpolitik/sustainable-finance.html)) with support of the associations, to have its financial portfolios examined voluntarily. The PACTA test combines a quantitative assessment of global listed equity and corporate bond portfolios as well as Swiss real estate and mortgage portfolios with a qualitative assessment of further climate actions. In total, 133 **CHECK** financial institutions participated, of which **[xx]** were peers (i.e., participants from same financial sector as pension funds; insurances; banks; asset managers).

This executive summary is a short   of the individual results of your uploaded portfolio `r investor_name`. [XY] received one executive summary per portfolio. A detailed individual interactive report (per portfolio or grouped) can be viewed by [XY] via personalized access at platform.transitionmonitor.com ) in German, French, and partly English. A meta report with anonymized and aggregated data from all participants, together with sector reports, is published on the FOEN website [LINK] and is available for download.

### Measuring climate alignment

In the view of PACTA and FOEN, there are three main components that are useful to measure alignment with climate goals which are shown below. The icons are used throughout this document to indicate the category for each chart.

Text in 3 columns

col 1

**Exposure:** provides insights in how exposed your portfolio is to climate-relevant sectors, incl. buildings, and therefore offers a risk-perspective to climate alignment.

col2

**Trajectory alignment:** Measures alignment of invested companies’ production plans or buildings’ refurbishment plans with climate scenarios and thereby allocates responsibility and risk to each company and building.

col 3

**Engagement & other qualitative indicators:** complementing analysis with information on climate actions that can have real-world climate impact.



### Equity & bonds module overview

The analysis of the listed equity and corporate bond portfolios covers 8 climate-relevant sectors*. For these sectors, the exposure as well as the alignment with a pathway to limit global warming well below 1.5 degrees (Paris Agreement) has been analyzed. 
The trajectory alignment measurement was done using the PACTA method. PACTA compares forward-looking production plans of all invested companies in the PACTA sectors on a technology level to the targets from climate scenarios. For more information on the PACTA methodology, please refer to [link with new documentation].

```{r diagram, eval = FALSE}
#FIXME: make sure we evaluate this plot, once fixed.

## Equity & Bonds Results

### Current state (PACTA sectors)

#### Exposure* to climate-relevant sectors & technologies as % of AUM

The chart provides information on the exposure to the PACTA sectors. Fossil fuels (extraction) is shown aggregated as well as disaggregated for peer- and index-comparison.

```{r exposure}
# the specific PACTA outputs that we need here are my guesses 
data_green_brown_bars <- prep_green_brown_bars(
  results_portfolio = results_portfolio,
  scenario_selected = scenario_selected
)
plot_green_brown_bars(data_green_brown_bars)
```

```{r exposure_fossil}
# the specific PACTA outputs that we need here are my guesses 
data_fossil_bars <- prep_fossil_bars(
  results_portfolio = results_portfolio,
  peers_results_aggregated = peers_results_aggregated,
  indices_results_portfolio = indices_results_portfolio,
  scenario_selected = scenario_selected
)
plot_fossil_bars(data_fossil_bars)
```

### Current & future state (power sector)

#### Current exposure vs. future alignment for Power sector

The chart below shows the current low-carbon exposure and the forward-looking climate scenario alignment in the power sector for you and your peers. The current exposure to low-carbon technologies in the power sector increases right-wards, while the alignment improves upwards. A significant increase in renewable energy capacity will be required to achieve a 1.5°C climate scenario, so even companies with a high current share of low-carbon technologies will need to build new capacity in order to be aligned in the future. A current high low-carbon share and a low future alignment would therefore indicate a lack of planned renewables investment.

```

### Future (Other PACTA sectors)

#### PACTA Aggregated Climate Alignment Score

The aggregated score compares the alignment of all assets until 2026 to the [XYZ] Scenario. The score is calculated both on aggregate portfolio level (see also Climate Scores page 10) and per PACTA sector (except for cement).

```{r scores_equity}
# the specific PACTA outputs that we need here are my guesses 
data_scores <- prep_scores(
  results_portfolio = results_portfolio,
  peers_results_aggregated = peers_results_aggregated,
  asset_class = "equity"
)
plot_scores(data_scores) +
  patchwork::plot_annotation(
    title = "Equity",
    theme = theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5, size = 22))
    )
```

```{r scores_bonds}
# the specific PACTA outputs that we need here are my guesses

### Transition

#### Scenario alignment per technology

While the previous section provided insights on the current exposure to the different PACTA sectors as well as an overview of the alignment on an aggregated level and sector level, this section provides complementary insights into alignment on a technology level. 
The charts below indicate with which scenario the technologies in your portfolio are aligned, in comparison to your peers. The position of each square within the color strips defines the scenario with which your portfolio and your peers’ portfolios are aligned in 5 years from now. The size of the squares indicates the exposure as % of AUM.
To learn more about how the alignment of your portfolio evolves over the next five years per technology, you can find the respective trajectory charts in the interactive report. There you will also find additional information on company-level.

```{r alignment_table_bonds, fig.height = 6}
# the specific PACTA outputs that we need here are my guesses 
data_alignment_table <- prep_alignment_table(
  results_portfolio = results_portfolio, 
  peers_results_aggregated = peers_results_aggregated,
  asset_class = "bonds"
)
plot_alignment_table(data_alignment_table)
# TODO: add title
```


```{r alignment_table_equity, fig.height = 6}
# the specific PACTA outputs that we need here are my guesses

## Climate Action Survey

This section provides insights in the effectiveness of climate actions on an institutional level. The results base on the complementary qualitative climate action survey. The survey results are compared to peers and the quantitative results of this portfolio. Please note that survey answers were self-reported and not verified by 2DII, RMI, and WP.

Text in a box:
**Explanation on dart charts below:** The dart charts are a newly developed chart type that depicts your climate-relevant measures. Each circle represents one climate relevant measure and is colored in case the measure is in place. The level of effectiveness of the measures increases from the outer to the inner ring and with colour intensity. The more circles are filled from the outer to the inner circle, the more ambitious are your institution’s climate actions. For more information on the specific measures shown in the layers, please refer to page 7. 

### Overview

On the left hand side, you find the initiatives you are part of. The larger the font size, the more peers are part of it. In the middle, you see a dart chart indicating your climate. On the right, you can see how many of your peers have all three climate strategies in place, which is considered as best practice.

```{r plot_wordcloud, fig.height = 6}

### Investee engagement per sector

Research shows that engagement is one of the most effective ways to improve climate goal alignment of companies invested through equity and bonds. Therefore, the engagement dart charts below show your engagement measures for three climate crucial sectors and thereby complement the previous alignment section. The text besides provides a comparison to the share of peers with best practice, i.e., the ones that have all layers covered.

### Negative screening vs. fossil fuel PACTA exposure

These charts compare the reported climate-aligned strategies to the exposure to coal mining and oil & gas extraction. If exclusion strategies are applied at an institutional level, it is expected that exposure in these technologies will be zero or very low compared to the total portfolios peers.

## Climate Score Indicators

### PACTA Executive Summary 2022

The following three pages of the “Climate Scores” complement the PACTA Executive Summary by showing automatically generated results on portfolio-level, based on the Swiss Climate Scores. As the [Swiss Climate Scores](https://www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/finanzmarktpolitik/sustainable-finance.html) were defined during the PACTA Climate Test 2022, there are some deviations which are noted on the explanation page. Please note that the indicators on exposure to fossil fuels and the Global Warming Alignment are based on the PACTA methodology and sectors.

### Current State

#### Carbon Footprint

All sources of carbon emissions from invested companies (scope 1-3) are included in the estimation.

```{r emissions_scorecard}
# the specific PACTA outputs that we need here are my guesses 
data_emissions_scorecard <- prep_emissions_scorecard(emissions_data)
plot_emissions_scorecard(data_emissions_scorecard)
```

```{r emissions_scorecard_info}
total_portfolio_value_curr <- audit_data %>%
  dplyr::mutate(value_usd = dplyr::if_else(value_usd < 0, 0, value_usd)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(value_curr = value_usd / currency_exchange_value) %>%
  dplyr::pull(value_curr) %>%
  sum(na.rm = TRUE)

total_portfolio_percentage_equity <- (audit_data %>%
  filter(asset_type == "Equity") %>%
  mutate(value_curr = value_usd/currency_exchange_value) %>%
  dplyr::pull(value_curr) %>%
  sum(na.rm =T)) /
  total_portfolio_value_curr

total_portfolio_percentage_bonds <- (audit_data %>%
  filter(asset_type == "Bonds") %>%
  mutate(value_curr = value_usd/currency_exchange_value) %>%
  dplyr::pull(value_curr) %>%
  sum(na.rm =T)) /
  total_portfolio_value_curr

total_portfolio_percentage_coverage <- (total_portfolio_percentage_equity + total_portfolio_percentage_bonds)
  
```
Benchmark:
|Listed Equity |Corporate Bonds |
|:-------------|:---------------|
|iShares MSCI World ETF | iShares Global Corp Bond UCITS ETF |


Portfolio assets covered by assessment: **`r total_portfolio_percentage_coverage * 100` %**

#### Exposure to fossil fuels and renewable power, based on PACTA methodology

There is scientific consensus on the need to phase-out coal, stop financing new fossil fuel projects, and to increase renewable power capacity. Below figure shows the financial exposure (as AUM in %) of this portfolio to technologies in the industries coal mining, oil and gas upstream, fossil fuel power production, and renewable power production. The PACTA exposure is based on production capacities and not on revenues. 


```{r exposures_scorecard}
# the specific PACTA outputs that we need here are my guesses 
data_exposures_scorecard <- prep_exposures_scorecard(results_portfolio)
plot_exposures_scorecard(data_exposures_scorecard)
```

### Transition to Net zero

#### PACTA Aggregated Climate Alignment Score

```{r scores_scorecard}
# the specific PACTA outputs that we need here are my guesses 
data_scores_scorecard <- prep_scores_scorecard(results_portfolio)
plot_scores_scorecard(data_scores_scorecard)

# TODO: needs to return actual scenario name
```

This score represents the estimated aggregate alignment of the PACTA sectors (except for cement) in the portfolio with respect to the GECO 2021 scenarios. Please bear in mind that the interpretation of this score should be accompanied by an analysis of the underlying results and investment strategy used in each one of the analysed sectors, given the assumptions that an aggregated metric is based on. Some portfolios with climate objectives may intentionally include investments in companies that are not yet on track to achieve 1.5°C alignment, seeking instead to contribute actively to climate goals by improving the alignment of investee companies to bring a larger share of the economy into alignment over time. The combined set of indicators above and their display are considered by the Swiss government to represent the current best-practice in providing science-based transparency on the alignment of portfolio assets with global climate goals.

```{r general_info, fig.height = 6}
# TODO: add % emissions covered by assessment

```

Portfolio assets covered by assessment: **`r total_portfolio_percentage_coverage * 100` %**

Climate scenario used: **GECO 2021**

#### Verified Commitments to Net-Zero

Companies are increasingly making voluntary commitments to transition to net-zero and set interim targets. The effectiveness of such commitments depends on whether interim targets are credible, science-based, and transparent. The following information is based on information from [SBTi](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action).

```{r sbti_net_zero_commitments, fig.height = 6}
fin_data_net_zero_targets <- readr::read_csv(file.path(survey_dir, language, "fin_data_net_zero_targets.csv"))

peer_group_share_net_zero <- readr::read_csv(file.path(survey_dir, language, "peer_group_share_net_zero.csv"))

data_prep_net_zero_commitments <- prep_net_zero_commitments(
  total_portfolio = total_portfolio,
  peer_group = peer_group,
  net_zero_targets = fin_data_net_zero_targets,
  peer_group_share_net_zero = peer_group_share_net_zero
)

knitr::kable(data_prep_net_zero_commitments)
# TODO: add title - SBTI net zero commitments.

### Exposure to climate-relevant sectors & technologies as % of AUM

Chart_sample 1

Chart_sample 2

The bar chart on the left shows the portfolio's exposure to each of the eight PACTA sectors as a percentage of assets under management. The bars are arranged by the amount of exposure in descending order. In addition, a breakdown of technologies (low-carbon, carbon-intensive, unspecified) is provided for those sectors for which such a breakdown is defined. The graph on the right shows the exposure to the fossil fuel extraction sector as a breakdown between the different fossil fuels coal, oil and gas. In addition, a comparison with peers (pension funds, insurance companies, banks or asset managers) as well as with an ETF for the MSCI World Index can be seen.

### Current exposure vs. future alignment for power sector

Chart_sample 3

This chart shows current low-carbon technology exposure (percentage of sectoral exposure, x-axis) plotted against the sector-level alignment metric (alignment score, y-axis). Coloured dots represent different entities (portfolio, average of all participants, average of peers). It investigates the relation between the two values as well as provides context for the alignment score. Ideally, an insitution would like to be positioned in the upper right corner (high exposure to low-carbon and high alignment). The bottom left corner is the least desired position (low exposure to low-carbon and low alignment).

### Aggregated alignment scores

Chart_sample 4

This chart displays the alignment scores both on the aggreagte level (left-most bar) and on sector level. The bigger, dark-blue triangle indicates the score obtained by this portfolio and the smaller grey triangle indicates the average peer result. The horizontal line delineates the scores aligned with the 1.8°C pathway (or higher) from those that are not aligned. The 1.8°C pathway matches with the target in the Paris Agreement of limiting global warming to “well below 2°C”. The scores indicate the scenario with which the production plans of the invested companies align. Please refer to the two visualizations below for more information. 

### Scenario choice and grading

This table shows the technical specifications in regard to the scenarios to define the score. For each score, one can see the requirements in regard to each scenario in the same row.

table_scenario_grading

### Example of production plans for a green technology according to the scores. 

The chart below visualizes the specifications of the aggregated alignment score for an examplary production plan of a green technology. To derive the aggregated score, the sector-level scores are aggregated to one score.

### Dart chart: overall climate strategy

Chart_sample 5

This dart chart shows whether your institution as a whole, according to your answers, practices reporting, has a climate strategy in place, and has concrete climate targets. An increasing efficacy from the first (outer layer) to the third (inner layer) is assumed. Best practice is defined as having all three layers covered.
Transparency through reporting is a first step in the right direction, but ultimately a concrete climate goal needs to be set and backed by a trustworthy climate strategy to make a change. 

### Dart chart: investee engagement in fossil fuel, automotive, and power sector

Chart_sample 6

This dart charts shows which engagement actions your institution is practicing, accoding to your answers. It starts with a general engagement policy, which can be improved in effectiveness through a dedicated engagement team and finally through joint engagement with other institutions. Best practice is when all three levels are covered.
The chart is shown separately for fossil fuels, automotive, and power sector as these (i) are considered as the most climate relevant sectors and (ii) have low-carbon substitutes which allows investors to support the shift to existing technologies. 
Considering joint engagement as a way to increase the efficacy of engagement practices is echoed by literature on the topic and supported by, for example, the NZAOA **(Link to report here)**. 


### Dart chart: negative screening in oil and gas as well as coal sector

Chart_sample 7

This dart chart shows whether your institution as a whole, according to your answers, has exclusion criteria defined, practices underweighting in the respective sectors as well as excludes companies if your action is not successful. Best practice is defined as having all three layers covered. 
This layer chart is shown for coal on the one hand and oil and gas on the other hand separately, and compared to the exposure in the respective sectors. The comparison to the PACTA exposure aims to provide insights in the effectiveness of the negative screening actions.

## Annex (IV): FAQs

### Which are the PACTA sectors?

The PACTA analysis covers 8 climate-relevant sectors: coal mining, oil & gas production, power generation (fossil and renewable); automotive production (ICE , hybrid, electric), aviation, cement, and steel.
Usually, 5-15% of FI’s portfolios are invested in these sectors. Even though the financial exposure can seem small, the investments still, on average, account for a much larger share of emissions. Please see the graphs of a sample portfolio below:

#### Financial Exposure

Chart_sample 7

#### Emission Exposure

Chart_sample 8

### Which asset classes does PACTA cover? 

The PACTA methodology covers listed equity and corporate bonds. In cooperation with Wüest Partner AG, the PACTA Test Switzerland 2022 also includes Swiss real estate and mortgages. 

Placeholder: Information on coverage of equity, bonds, and Swiss buildings to be added (once we know).


### How can I use my results for disclosure?

To what extent you use your results is up to you. However, the results are suitable for a variety of reporting opportunities, such as:

* Internal reporting and communication
* Reporting in the environment of the participating financial institution (clients, insured parties etc.)
* External disclosure: Implementing the federal council’s recommendations ([Link](https://www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/documentation/press-releases/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-85925.html)) to use comparable and meaningful climate compatibility indicators to help create transparency in all financial products and client portfolios incl. indicators following the Swiss Climate Scores ([Link](https://www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/swiss-climate-scores/valuation-parameters.html)).
* Details on how to use the results for reporting according to TCFD, the EU SFDR or EU Taxonomy can be found in the following report: [The Disclosure Puzzle – the role of PACTA](https://2degrees-investing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PACTA-disclosures-report.pdf).
