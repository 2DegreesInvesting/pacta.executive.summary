\begin{esbox}{Equity \& bonds module overview}[\exposureImage]

The analysis of the listed equity and corporate bond portfolios covers 8 climate-relevant sectors. For these sectors, the exposure as well as the alignment with a pathway to limit global warming well below 2\textdegree C (Paris Agreement) has been analyzed. The trajectory alignment measurement was done using the PACTA method. PACTA compares forward-looking production plans of all invested companies in the PACTA sectors on a technology level to the targets from climate scenarios. For more information on the PACTA methodology, please refer to the PACTA Knowledge Hub \textbf{(\href{https://rmi.gitbook.io/pacta-knowledge-hub/}{link})}.

\textbf{Current exposure vs. future alignment for Power sector}

The chart below shows the current low-carbon exposure and the forward-looking climate scenario alignment in the power sector for you and your peers. The current exposure to low-carbon technologies in the power sector increases right-wards, while the alignment improves upwards. A significant increase in renewable energy capacity will be required to achieve a 1.5\textdegree C climate scenario, so even companies with a high current share of low-carbon technologies will need to build new capacity in order to be aligned in the future. A current high low-carbon share and a low future alignment would therefore indicate a lack of planned renewables investment.

The aggregated score compares the alignment of all assets until 2028 to the WEO 2023 Scenario. The score is calculated both on aggregate portfolio level (see also Climate Scores) and per PACTA sector.\footnote{WEO 2023 was chosen since it provided data coverage for all PACTA sectors. More information about how WEO 2023 compares with GECO 2021 is provided in the comments section at the end of this executive summary.}

\textbf{Scenario alignment per technology}

While the previous section provided insights on the current exposure to the different PACTA sectors as well as an overview of the alignment on an aggregated level and sector level, this section provides complementary insights into alignment with the WEO 2023 scenario on a technology level for the PACTA sectors with technology roadmaps.
The charts below indicate with which scenario the technologies in your portfolio are aligned, in comparison to your peers. The position of each square within the color strips defines the scenario with which your portfolio and your peers’ portfolios are aligned in 5 years from now. The size of the squares indicates the exposure as \% of AUM.
To learn more about how the alignment of your portfolio evolves over the next five years per technology, you can find the respective trajectory charts in the interactive report. There you will also find additional information on company-level.

The bar chart on the left shows the portfolio's exposure to each of the eight PACTA sectors as a percentage of assets under management. The bars are arranged by the amount of exposure in descending order. In addition, a breakdown of technologies (low-carbon, carbon-intensive, unspecified) is provided for those sectors for which such a breakdown is defined. The graph on the right shows the exposure to the fossil fuel extraction sector as a breakdown between the different fossil fuels coal, oil and gas. In addition, a comparison with peers (pension funds, insurance companies, banks or asset managers) as well as with MSCI World Index can be seen.

\subsection{Current exposure vs. future alignment for power sector}


\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{chart_sample_3}

This chart shows current low-carbon technology exposure (percentage of sectoral exposure, x-axis) plotted against the sector-level alignment metric (alignment score, y-axis). Colored dots represent different entities (portfolio, average of all participants, average of peers). It investigates the relation between the two values as well as provides context for the alignment score. Ideally, an insitution would like to be positioned in the upper right corner (high exposure to low-carbon and high alignment). The bottom left corner is the least desired position (low exposure to low-carbon and low alignment).

This chart displays the alignment scores both on the aggregate level (left-most bar) and on sector level. The bigger, dark-blue triangle indicates the score obtained by this portfolio and the smaller grey triangle indicates the average peer result. The horizontal line delineates the scores aligned with the 1.8\textdegree C pathway (or higher) from those that are not aligned. The 1.8\textdegree C pathway matches with the target in the Paris Agreement of limiting global warming to “well below 2\textdegree C”. The scores indicate the scenario with which the production plans of the invested companies align. Please refer to the two visualizations below for more information.

This is an example dart chart for a user who employs best practices within the area the chart concerns (see the title, in this case exclusion policies within the oil sector). All the circles are filled with color from light to dark and all the labels are positive statemens. It means that the user applies all strategies and/or measures that are considered important or impactful within the area of concern, starting from the least effective (but important nevertheless), outer ring, to the most effective, inner circle.

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.65\textwidth}

This an example dart chart for a user who employs some good practices within the area the chart concerns (see the chart title, here 'Concrete climate measures within listed equity and corporate bonds') but not all. In this case user applies the measure considered to have a medium impact/importance which is having a sector based approach for a transion plan, but does not apply the other practices (concrete interim targets, and measures planned for achieving the interim targets). The middle ring is filled with color and has a label with a positive statement while the outer ring and inner circle are white and have labels with negative statements (starting with the word 'No'). In this case, user is on a good path but there are some areas of improvement. Especially the middle circle is important one to consider.

\end{minipage}%

This example dart chart would appear for a user who does not apply any of the best practices within the area the chart concerns (see the chart title, here 'Concrete climate measures within listed equity and corporate bonds'). All layers (rings and circles) are white and their labels are negative statements (they start with the word 'No'). In this case there is a room for improvement towards best practice (dart plot which is fully filled) within the area the chart is concerning and the chart can help to decide what should be the next steps relevant to the user's institution to support the alignment of financial flows with the net-zero goal by 2050.

\begin{esbox}{Which are the PACTA sectors?}

The PACTA analysis covers 8 climate-relevant sectors: coal, oil \& gas, power, automotive, cement, steel, and aviation. Usually, 5-15\% of FI’s portfolios are invested in these sectors. Even though the financial exposure can seem small, the investments still, on average, account for a much larger share of portfolio emissions. Please see the graphs of a sample portfolio below:
